Mornings at home which started with my dear Grandma performing Puja with flower petals dipped inside the Kalash. A refreshing memory from my childhood days and as I grew older I saw it was kept up by my mom. A Kalash was there in the Puja thali when I was going to study in India for my higher studies to wish me good luck.  There when I got married and left my house… and there when I was embraced and welcomed into my new home. Actually, it is there in everything auspicious and somehow reaffirms all our thoughts and decisions and makes us believe in ourselves and the spirit of a higher being that protects us.Little things and objects, small gestures, even words used… I realise they unknowingly give us strength, kept us going. So how can I not be inspired to design something that incorporates the same positivity in your life as it did in mine.If you are able to relate to any of those precious moments when a Kalash has been and continues to be a part of your life… when somebody who cared about you held a Puja thali and blessed you with all their will, and one day you find ourself doing the same, this special jewel is for you.Made in solid Gold and Diamonds to create a positive aura and definitely a conversation started with your next great friend.",Uncategorized

• Length: 18 Inches","Growing up, I have always seen a Kalash in everything Auspicious. Mornings at home which started with my dear Grandma performing Puja with flower petals dipped inside the Kalash. A refreshing memory from my childhood days and as I grew older I saw it was kept up by my mom. A Kalash was there in the Puja thali when I was going to study in India for my higher studies to wish me good luck.  There when I got married and left my house… and there when I was embraced and welcomed into my new home. Actually, it is there in everything auspicious and somehow reaffirms all our thoughts and decisions and makes us believe in ourselves and the spirit of a higher being that protects us.The woman you see before you today, is someone who has travelled from the lap of the himalayas to a life of jet setting around the world, someone who finds herself going back to the small things in her life that hold value.Little things and objects, small gestures, even words used… I realise they unknowingly have given me strength, kept us going. So how can I not be inspired to design something that incorporates the same positivity in your life as it did in mine.If you are able to relate to any of those precious moments when a Kalash has been and continues to be a part of your life… when somebody who cared about you held a Puja thali and blessed you with all their will, and one day you find ourself doing the same, this special jewel is for you.Made in solid Gold and Diamonds to create a positive aura and definitely, a conversation started with your next great friend.","Black Friday 2024?

I chose to place a malachite in the middle of the diamond as it’s a very beautiful green gemstone that has been used since historical times and has a very significant meaning.  It’s a stone believed to help build inner strength and opens the heart chakra so it’s valued for its protective and healing properties. So imagine the power of surrounding yourself or your baby with the added aura of Ganesh and everything above!When I explained to Priyanka the significance of the beautiful gemstone we both agreed that these are definitely our best wishes for baby Ayanka.Since then we have now added the Mommy Ganesh Pendant and due to many requests from our customers, it is now made available in our New Mommy and Baby collection. We hope you feel the love and protection too.Crafted to perfection for the woman who cherishes heirloom pieces but also has strong ties to her heritage.

Happy times will sometimes be followed by times when we doubt ourselves, feel intimidated, and question if we deserve to be where we are. But the truth is that no matter what, in good times and in bad, we have to keep going, got to be proactive, and give it our best. There’s no other way. I really wanted to create this as a reminder to myself and anyone else who might find strength and courage in that thought.
The Time Traveller Pendant incorporates an interesting elegant design with the diamonds dripping down like sand to remind us that time never stops. Whatever dreams we have… whatever passions we share…whatever happiness we want… it is now that we should work towards achieving that goal.
Be it someone’s special birthday, coming of age, graduation, or just because… this is also the most appropriate gift to mark a point in someone’s life.

• Diamond 0.185ct","Growing up, I have always seen a Kalash in everything Auspicious. Mornings at home which started with my dear Grandma performing Puja with flower petals dipped inside the Kalash. A refreshing memory from my childhood days and as I grew older I saw it was kept up by my mom. A Kalash was there in the Puja thali when I was going to study in India for my higher studies to wish me good luck.  There when I got married and left my house… and there when I was embraced and welcomed into my new home. Actually, it is there in everything auspicious and somehow reaffirms all our thoughts and decisions and makes us believe in ourselves and the spirit of a higher being that protects us.The woman you see before you today, is someone who has travelled from the lap of the himalayas to a life of jet setting around the world, someone who finds herself going back to the small things in her life that hold value.Little things and objects, small gestures, even words used… I realise they unknowingly have given me strength, kept us going. So how can I not be inspired to design something that incorporates the same positivity in your life as it did in mine.If you are able to relate to any of those precious moments when a Kalash has been and continues to be a part of your life… when somebody who cared about you held a Puja thali and blessed you with all their will, and one day you find ourself doing the same, this special jewel is for you.Made in solid Gold and Diamonds to create a positive aura and definitely a conversation started with your next great friend.","Black Friday 2024?
